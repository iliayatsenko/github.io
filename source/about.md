Here I post notes from my day-to-day work as a backend developer, mainly specialized in **PHP**.
I am interested in clean **modular architecture**, **domain-driven design** and **not-fragile automated tests**. If you need a consulting with these topics, do not hesitate to contact me via [_LinkedIn_](https://linkedin.com/in/%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%8F-%D1%8F%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE-543281a1).
