Here I post notes from my day-to-day work as a backend developer, mainly specialized in **PHP**.
I am interested in clean **modular architecture**, **domain-driven design** and **not-fragile automated tests**. If you need a consulting with these topics, do not hesitate to contact me via [_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilia-yatsenko-543281a1/).
